                                Even though this is Project 2 in the class, I was unable to complete Project 1 due to a death in the family. 
                                So, this is my first CS 424 project. The goal of the project is to visualize energy sources data (linked and explained more below) 
                                provided by Professor Johnson. This project only uses R as the programming language and was developed in RStudio. 
                                The final application was published on ShinyApps.io web application.

                        <u>Page 1:</u> The landing page of this ShinyApps application showcases the map of Illinois. Here, you can view the Energy Sources graphed on the map of Illinois and the legend is visible on the bottom right-hand side. The graph plots the plant locations of all energy plants in Illinois in 2018. There are multiple checkboxes to filter by individual or a combination of energy sources or use the “All” checkbox to plot all energy plants.

                        <u>Page 2:</u> The second page lets you compare two different states during a specific year. You again have the option to filter the data by individual or a combination of energy sources or just filter by “All”. All 50 states are available under the “Select State” drop down list. Right under the state selection, you will find the “Select Year” list. Here you can choose to plot the data from 2000, 2010 or 2018. The combinations possible to plot are very high, so give it a shot!

                        <u>Page 3:</u> The third page lets you view the plant locations all over USA. Again, you have the option to filter the data by individual or a combination of energy sources or just default filter by “All”. The USA map layout also includes Alaska and Hawaii. You can view the legend on the bottom right again as the locations are filtered by their energy source type.

                        As mentioned above, the data was linked to us by Professor which he got from epa.gov. I have attached the official link below and it is also available in the About section of the application. The data was downloaded from epa.gov and 3 main files were used in the creation of this application. The first file is titled “eGRID2018v2 Data File (XLSX)” and the other two files are from the eGRID historical files zip folder found towards the end of the page under “Other Historical Data”. From there, the data was processed and filtered in Microsoft Excel first and then converted to a CSV file to use in the RStudio environment. After importing the CSV files into RStudio, I renamed the columns for easier usage throughout the project. For example, changing “PLANT_NAME” column to “PLANTNAME” and “PL_OIL” to “OIL”. All 3 CSV files for the 2000, 2010 and 2018 data is available on my GitHub (linked below).

                    <p class="text-black mb-0"> 
                        There were a very few things I found interesting at the beginning of the project as I only started a few days before the project was due. It’s not that I procrastinated but that I’m enrolled in 21 credit hours as a last-semester Senior student. So, I literally have something due every day, including weekend. There were way too many bugs to begin with at the start of my project. It took me an entire day to just process and import the data correctly to the RStudio environment. However, when things started to work, I was very happy. Within the data specifically, the first thing that shocked me was the abundance of the data points within the Excel files I first downloaded. Literally, you name it, they have it type of data. I noticed how there are no Geothermal plants in Illinois. Wind, Gas and Oil are the top 3 energy sources in Illinois. There was only 1 solar energy plant in 2010 and an increase to a total of 5 in 2018 in Illinois. This was probably the biggest shocker for me for Illinois. I was really disappointed in the underwhelming number and lack of the Solar Energy Plants in Illinois. Alaska, Washington DC, North Dakota, New Hampshire and West Virginia all do not have any Solar Energy plants. Solar Energy had the highest increase in the number of energy plants from 2010 to 2018.

                        To replicate this project onto your own computer, start by downloading RStudio (I have version 1.4, but the latest version should work as well). Download the necessary data files and the application code from my GitHub (link below). If you want to make your own adjustments to the data, download the data from epa.gov/egrid/download-data. Store the data files and the .R code file in the same folder and open with RStudio. In the RStudio terminal/console, you will need to download the libraries that I used. You can do that with the <i> install.packages(“libraryNameIUsed”) </i> command. To create your own web application through ShinyApps, you will need to create your own account on their website: shiny.rstudio.com. Then connect your ShinyApps account to RStudio in the RStudio publishing settings. After connecting, you can post your application to ShinyApps through RStudio by clicking the blue icon next to Run App.
